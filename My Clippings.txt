“That’s a good question. I’d say it’s because … Look at the case of abortion. We can argue about it for a thousand years, but there’s never going to be an argument powerful enough to end the argument, because every argument has a counterargument. So it’s impossible to know what we should do. That’s why we need the prophet. The prophet knows.” “Yes, I think that’s it. But the question remains: Why don’t you know?” “I think the question remains because I can’t answer it.” “You know how to split atoms, how to send explorers to the moon, how to splice genes, but you don’t know how people ought to live.”

we use our funerals to revise the life of the dead, to give the dead a story so different from their actual life that, in effect, we kill them all over again. No, that is too strong. Let me just say that we erase them, we edit them, we make them into a person much easier to live with than the person who actually lived. I rejected that idea. I thought that a more appropriate funeral would be to say, honestly, what that person was and what that person did. But to me, “honesty” doesn’t simply mean saying all the unpleasant things instead of saying only the nice ones. It doesn’t even consist of averaging them out. No, to understand who a person really was, what his or her life really meant, the speaker for the dead would have to explain their self-story—what they meant to do, what they actually did, what they regretted, what they rejoiced in.

Eisenberger and Michael Adornetto found that the more children were exposed to delayed rewards, the more self-control they demonstrated in later challenges. For instance, when parents insist that their child stick to his tuba practice schedule even though it might be boring and tedious, they teach the child to accept discomfort and to put forth effort toward a goal.

There is an inverse error to generalizing from fictional evidence: failing to be sufficiently moved by historical evidence. The trouble with generalizing from fictional evidence is that it is fiction—it never actually happened. It’s not drawn from the same distribution as this, our real universe; fiction differs from reality in systematic ways. But history has happened, and should be available.

If I was very early stage, I might ask for an introduction to his boss or tech team or the budget-holder so I can make sure I fully understand their needs.  If I was slightly further through development, I might push him to agree to be one of our alpha users and to roll it out to some subset of their team and be a case study for launch. If I’ve hit on a real problem, he’ll jump at the chance to start making progress today and get early access.

Joel Gascoigne did a classic "landing page" test with his startup Buffer, describing the value proposition and collecting emails. But contrary to popular understanding, it wasn't the metrics or conversion rate which convinced him to move forward. Instead, it was the conversations which resulted from emailing every single person who signed up and saying hello. I'm skeptical of the quantitative validation of landing page metrics. But they are certainly a great way to collect emails of qualified leads for you to reach out to and strike up a conversation with.

horrible problem X, usher in wonderful vision Y, or fix stagnant industry Z. Don't mention your idea. Frame expectations by mentioning what stage you're at and, if it's true, that you don't have anything to sell. Show weakness and give them a chance to help by mentioning your specific problem that you're looking for answers on. This will also clarify that you're not a time waster. Put them on a pedestal by showing how much they, in particular, can help. Ask for help.

It’s easier to guide the conversation and stay on track if you have an existing set of beliefs that you’re updating. Spend up to an hour writing down your best guesses about what the person you’re about to talk to cares about and wants.

It is dangerous to have a prescriptive principle which you only vaguely comprehend; your mental picture may have so many degrees of freedom that it can adapt to justify almost any deed. Where people have vague mental models that can be used to argue anything, they usually end up believing whatever they started out wanting to believe.

while many religious assertions are very hard to believe, it is easy for people to believe that they ought to believe them. Dennett terms this “belief in belief.” What would it mean to really assume, to really believe, that three is equal to one? It’s a lot easier to believe that you should, somehow, believe that three equals one, and to make this response at the appropriate points in church. Dennett suggests that much “religious belief” should be studied as “religious profession”—what people think they should believe and what they know they ought to say.

Believing in Santa Claus gives children a sense of wonder and encourages them to behave well in hope of receiving presents. If Santa-belief is destroyed by truth, the children will lose their sense of wonder and stop behaving nicely. Therefore, even though Santa-belief is false-to-fact, it is a Noble Lie whose net benefit should be preserved for utilitarian reasons. Classically, this is known as a false dilemma, the fallacy of the excluded middle, or the package-deal fallacy. Even if we accept the underlying factual and moral premises of the above argument, it does not carry through. Even supposing that the Santa policy (encourage children to believe in Santa Claus) is better than the null policy (do nothing), it does not follow that Santa-ism is the best of all possible alternatives.

If the goal is really to help people, then a superior alternative is cause for celebration—once we find this better strategy, we can help people more effectively. But if the goal is to justify a particular strategy by claiming that it helps people, a Third Alternative is an enemy argument, a competitor.

Modern cognitive psychology views decision-making as a search for alternatives. In real life, it’s not enough to compare options; you have to generate the options in the first place. On many problems, the number of alternatives is huge, so you need a stopping criterion for the search.

defend lottery-ticket buying as a rational purchase of fantasy—paying a dollar for a day’s worth of pleasant anticipation, imagining yourself as a millionaire. But consider exactly what this implies. It would mean that you’re occupying your valuable brain with a fantasy whose real probability is nearly zero—a tiny line of likelihood which you, yourself, can do nothing to realize. The lottery balls will decide your future. The fantasy is of wealth that arrives without effort—without conscientiousness, learning, charisma, or even patience.

Every worldview imposes some of its structure on its observations, but the point is that there are worldviews which try to minimize that imposition, and worldviews which glory in it. There is no white, but there are shades of gray that are far lighter than others, and it is folly to treat them as if they were all on the same level.

“Would you be willing to change your mind about the things you call ‘certain’ if you saw enough evidence? I mean, suppose that God himself descended from the clouds and told you that your whole religion was true except for the Virgin Birth. If that would change your mind, you can’t say you’re absolutely certain of the Virgin Birth. For technical reasons of probability theory, if it’s theoretically possible for you to change your mind about something, it can’t have a probability exactly equal to one. The uncertainty might be smaller than a dust speck, but it has to be there. And if you wouldn’t change your mind even if God told you otherwise, then you have a problem with refusing to admit you’re wrong that transcends anything a mortal like me can say to you, I guess.”

Open house. Over the years, I have held factory open houses for the friends and family of employees. These were fun events with food, activities, and a chance for employees to show off where they work and what they did. Letters home. One of the things I like to do is send a letter to the home of an employee who has done something above and beyond. It’s more powerful than just giving it to them at work. When the letter is sent home, the employee’s family can see it as well. Buddy the Elf. At one business, I had the annual Christmas tradition to dress up like Buddy the Elf. I would climb on the back of an electric maintenance cart with another manager dressed as Santa. We would ride around the plant and give out candy to all the employees. Wall of fame. I started a tradition at one plant of hanging pictures in the lobby of employees who received a patent and those who had qualified as a Six Sigma Black Belt. Every customer coming to our plant knew who our rock stars were.

There was a side to him that was frighteningly cold.” When Jobs did not want to deal with a distraction, he sometimes just ignored it, as if he could will it out of existence. At times he was able to distort reality not just for others but even for himself. In the case of Brennan’s pregnancy, he simply shut it out of his mind. When confronted, he would deny that he knew he was the father, even though he admitted that he had been sleeping with her. “I wasn’t sure it was my kid, because I was pretty sure I wasn’t the only one she was sleeping with,” he told me later.

If you told him that you made a particular choice because ‘it was the standard way things had always been done,’ he’d kick you out of a meeting fast. He’d say, ‘I never want to hear that phrase again. What we have to do is fucking hard and half-assing things won’t be tolerated.’ He just destroys you and, if you survive, he determines if he can trust you. He has to understand that you’re as crazy as he is.” This ethos filtered through the entire company, and everyone quickly understood that Musk meant business.

Many of the key executives who helped start the company, however, have hung on for a decade or more. Among the rank-and-file engineers, most people stay on for at least five years to have their stock options vest and to see their projects through. This is typical behavior for any technology company.

There is a creeping tendency to use made up acronyms at SpaceX. Excessive use of made up acronyms is a significant impediment to communication and keeping communication good as we grow is incredibly important. Individually, a few acronyms here and there may not seem so bad, but if a thousand people are making these up, over time the result will be a huge glossary that we have to issue to new employees. No one can actually remember all these acronyms and people don’t want to seem dumb in a meeting, so they just sit there in ignorance. This is particularly tough on new employees. That needs to stop immediately or I will take drastic action—I have given enough warnings over the years. Unless an acronym is approved by me, it should not enter the SpaceX glossary. If there is an existing acronym that cannot reasonably be justified, it should be eliminated, as I have requested in the past.

“There is a fundamental problem with regulators. If a regulator agrees to change a rule and something bad happens, they could easily lose their career. Whereas if they change a rule and something good happens, they don’t even get a reward. So, it’s very asymmetric. It’s then very easy to understand why regulators resist changing the rules. It’s because there’s a big punishment on one side and no reward on the other. How would any rational person behave in such a scenario?”

June 7, 2013 Going Public Per my recent comments, I am increasingly concerned about SpaceX going public before the Mars transport system is in place. Creating the technology needed to establish life on Mars is and always has been the fundamental goal of SpaceX. If being a public company diminishes that likelihood, then we should not do so until Mars is secure. This is something that I am open to reconsidering, but, given my experiences with Tesla and SolarCity, I am hesitant to foist being public on SpaceX, especially given the long term nature of our mission.

French philosopher Émile-Auguste Chartier (known as Alain), was said to be the finest teacher in France in the first half of the 20th century. And he developed a formula for calming himself and his pupils down in the face of irritating people. ‘Never say that people are evil,’ he wrote. ‘You just need to look for the pin.’ What he meant was: look for the source of the agony that drives a person to behave in appalling ways. The calming thought is to imagine that they are suffering offstage, in some area we cannot see. To be mature is to learn to imagine this zone of pain, in spite of the lack of much available evidence. They may not look as if they were maddened by an inner psychological ailment: they may look chirpy and full of themselves. But the ‘pin’ simply must be there – or they would not be causing us harm. Alain was drawing on one of the great techniques of literary fiction: the ability to take us into the mind of a character, perhaps a very unglamorous or initially off-putting figure, and show us the powerful – but unexpected – things that are going on in their mind. It was a move a novelist like Dostoevsky was deeply excited by: he’d take the kinds of characters that his readers would normally dismiss with a shudder – an outcast, a criminal, a gambler – and describe the complex depths of their inner lives, their capacity for remorse, their hopes, their powers of sensitive perception. This move – the accurate, corrective, reimagining of the inner lives of others – is relevant far outside the realm of literary fiction. It’s a piece of empathetic reflection we constantly need to perform with ourselves and with others. We need to imagine the turmoil, disappointment, worry and sadness in people who may outwardly appear merely aggressive. We need to aim compassion in an unexpected place: at those who annoy us most.

If what they are doing is particularly fun, rewarding, or interesting, many adults with ADHD may also find it hard to stop even when they’re not making mistakes but need to get on with another task that needs to be done soon but is far less interesting. While some advocates for adults with ADHD call this “hyperfocusing,” researchers call this problem perseveration. Perseveration often looks like procrastination. But as you might know, it’s not that the person has decided to put off something that isn’t fun. It’s that he or she decided to keep going on something that is fun.

✓  You have little or no feel for the passage of time, have trouble judging how much time activities will take, and cannot manage yourself well relative to the passage of time. When nonverbal working memory and its related sense of time are disturbed by ADHD, it can leave an adult without a typical sense of time. All that seems to matter to you is what is happening now. So you live much of your life in the now rather than getting ready for what is going to happen next. It can also leave you with a sense that time is passing much more slowly than it really is. This can make you feel like you have a lot more time to get things done than you actually have. It may cause you to waste time doing things that are irrelevant to your goals or tasks. Events, deadlines, or the future itself generally arrive much sooner than expected and catch you off guard, often leaving you in a panic or a crisis.

You may not make a good team player … or know how to be a good friend. When the grasshopper was starving, the ant rebuked him for failing to think ahead and create a nutritional stockpile. Social insurance can save your life. But if you have no concept of the future, sharing what you have with others makes no sense. All you can appreciate at the moment is the loss of your own hard-earned assets. You can see where this is going for adults with ADHD: You may have little capacity for or interest in sharing, cooperation, turn taking, and repaying the favors of others or fulfilling the promises you’ve made to them. They may very well respond to your requests for help as the ant did to the grasshopper.

2. We can motivate ourselves when we don’t have external rewards to push us. Call it drive, willpower, persistence, determination, stick-to-itiveness—what have you. I call it the mind’s fuel tank because it generates the internal “fuel” or drive that powers us toward our goals. While I and many other neuropsychologists think of this as a separate executive function (the sixth here in my list), I combine it with emotional self-control because that is what helps to create our self-motivation. The former is therefore indispensable to the latter. By regulating and even creating our emotions with the other executive functions discussed above, we endow ourselves with internal motivation when no one else is handing us any incentive from the outside. Again, it’s the four earlier executive functions working in concert that allow us to both self-regulate our emotions and then motivate ourselves to keep going when the going gets tough (or boring). Let’s say you want to volunteer with an organization devoted to protecting the environment. You make phone call after phone call asking people to support a major recycling effort. Before long you’re extremely dejected at all the rejections you get. In that case you use two of the executive functions you already have (visual imagery, self-talk) to remind you of your successes so far, keep your eye on the ultimate goal, and push you to keep making those calls. If envisioning your success and the potential for reaching the goal isn’t enough to get you to pick up that phone again, maybe you intentionally conjure up images of the destruction of the planet and use the anger these images stimulate to motivate you onward.

You’re not going to get the same findings, and if you try to replicate that experience simply based on the survey, you’re going to impart a “superficial sushi taste” to the product you’re designing.

Complexity produces a fundamentally different situation from the complicated challenges of the past; complicated problems required great effort, but ultimately yielded to prediction.

We realized that in order to prevail, our Task Force would need to become a true network.

Fundamental structural differences separate commands from teams. The former is rooted in reductionist prediction, and very good at executing planned procedures efficiently. The latter is less efficient, but much more adaptable. The connectivity of trust and purpose imbues teams with an ability to solve problems that could never be foreseen by a single manager—their solutions often emerge as the bottom-up result of interactions, rather than from top-down orders. In recent decades, teams have proliferated across domains previously dominated by commands in response to rising tactical complexity. The adaptability of the Task Force’s teams represented a valuable start, but we would have to build that same adaptability at a much greater scale.

We didn’t need every member of the Task Force to know everyone else; we just needed everyone to know someone on every team, so that when they thought about, or had to work with, the unit that bunked next door or their intelligence counterparts in D.C., they envisioned a friendly face rather than a competitive rival. We didn’t need everybody to follow every single operation in real time (something just as impossible as building lifelong friendships with seven thousand people).

For example, we would require that an Army Special Forces operator embed with a SEAL team. The Special Forces are characterized by exceptional discipline at the individual level, while SEALs pride themselves on creative thinking at the operator level and a strong sense of individuality. The points of tension were predictable. But the Special Forces operator would soon realize the cultural norms of the SEALs and, while remaining true to his home unit’s ethos, find a way to work effectively within the new structure. Over time, he would also begin to see some of the positives of the alternative approach, ultimately learning from SEAL culture and finding strengths that he could bring back to his team. The SEALs, meanwhile, would see in the Army operator the strengths of the culture that he came from, realizing that the individuality promoted there clearly comes with strengths that they could learn from. As an added bonus, each unit wouldn’t see the exchanged operator as a one-off example; rather, they would see their newfound friend as representative of the entire unit from which he came—and their feelings of trust and understanding would expand to the other unit, even if they’d only really gotten to know a single operator. This connective tissue grew stronger. When these operators returned to their home unit, their positive comments on the rival unit would spread, deepening the ties between teams. Slowly, we grew the bonds of trust needed for us to overcome our Prisoner’s Dilemma.

With minimal increases in personnel and funding, we were running seventeen times faster. And these raids were more successful.

adopted a practice I called “thinking out loud,” in which I would summarize what I’d heard, describe how I processed the information, and outline my first thoughts on what we should consider doing about it. It allowed the entire command to follow (and correct where appropriate) my logic trail, and to understand how I was thinking. After I did that, in a pointed effort to reinforce empowered execution, I would often ask the subordinate to consider what action might be appropriate and tell me what he or she planned to do.

I told them I was doing the same with them. “You have the right to judge in person the leader who represents you—and I have the right to size you up as well.” I avoided talking down to them, and I tried to understand and respect their perspective.

Creating and leading a truly adaptive organization requires building, leading, and maintaining a culture that is flexible but also durable. The primary responsibility of the new leader is to maintain a holistic, big-picture view, avoiding a reductionist approach, no matter how tempting micromanaging may be.

Although we intuitively know the world has changed, most leaders reflect a model and leader development process that are sorely out of date. We often demand unrealistic levels of knowledge in leaders and force them into ineffective attempts to micromanage. The temptation to lead as a chess master, controlling each move of the organization, must give way to an approach as a gardener, enabling rather than directing. A gardening approach to leadership is anything but passive. The leader acts as an “Eyes-On, Hands-Off” enabler who creates and maintains an ecosystem in which the organization operates.

Shared consciousness is a carefully maintained set of centralized forums for bringing people together. Empowered execution is a radically decentralized system for pushing authority out to the edges of the organization. Together, with these as the beating heart of our transformation, we became a single, cohesive unit far more agile than its size would suggest. Unlike the items in a MECE checklist, neither of these can be instituted alone; only when fused can they power an organization. As with team members, complex system components, and other dynamics we have discussed in the book, the union of shared consciousness and empowered execution is greater than the sum of their parts.

As our Task Force transformed itself, both our speed and precision improved dramatically. This was not a triumph of fine-tuning it into a hyperefficient machine. It had become a more transparent, more organic entity. Technology had been both a cause of our challenge and a tool for our success. But it was the culture change in the organization that allowed the Task Force to use it properly. At the core of the Task Force’s journey to adaptability lay a yin-and-yang symmetry of shared consciousness, achieved through strict, centralized forums for communication and extreme transparency, and empowered execution, which involved the decentralization of managerial authority. Together, these powered our Task Force; neither would suffice alone. Our transformation is reflective of the new generation of mental models we must adopt in order to make sense of the twenty-first century. If we do manage to embrace this change, we can unlock tremendous potential for human progress.

This counterintuitive clash results from the central challenge entrepreneurs face—the “resource-dependence” challenge.13 Founders need to attract outside resources—people, information, and money—in order to pursue opportunities and build the greatest value.14 But acquiring these resources typically requires that founders cede more and more control. Cofounders and key employees want equity. Skilled and experienced employees want to call some of their own shots. Investors want to protect their investments, typically by means of a strong presence on the startup’s board and by other terms of the deal structure.

Founding a startup requires the knitting together of all of the functions required to make an organization run effectively, from product development to marketing to sales to finance to human resources. Having prior experience in those functions arms the founder with the ability to understand how each one operates on its own and as part of the larger whole. Founders who lack experience in a function either will be blind to key aspects of how it contributes to the whole or will have to spend valuable time learning about it rather than building the startup. One challenge for young founders is that it takes many years to accumulate multifunction or general management experience.

When a specialist identifies with their specialty more than with the product they’re actually making, Dourambeis knows she still has work to do.

In a wiser, more ambitious arrangement of society, we would have music trials akin to medical trials, with acoustic laboratories making slight adjustments to all the elements that make up a piece of music – the rhythm, tonal range, melodic line, timbre and pitch of the sounds – and assess the difference this makes on those who listen to it. We would be building up knowledge of what aural interventions could work in relation to which species of agitation. We would determine that some people might have an adverse reaction to an A minor and that a flute would, for example, be especially relevant to tensions around sexual fantasy within marriages.

This is why underdog strategies, in situations where the starting balance of power would predict defeat, provide the real tests of creativity. Such strategies often look to the possibility of success through the application of a superior intelligence, which takes advantage of the boring, ponderous, muscle-bound approach adopted by those who take their superior resources for granted

By playing on the psychological weaknesses of the opponent, by maneuvering him into precarious positions, by inducing feelings of frustration and confusion, a strategist can get the other side to break down mentally before surrendering physically. In this way victory can be had at a much lower cost. And the state that wins wars with few lives lost and resources squandered is the state that can thrive over greater periods of time.

War is not some separate realm divorced from the rest of society. It is an eminently human arena, full of the best and the worst of our nature. War also reflects trends in society. The evolution toward more unconventional, dirtier strategies--guerrilla warfare, terrorism--mirrors a similar evolution in society, where almost anything goes. The strategies that succeed in war, whether conventional or unconventional, are based on timeless psychology, and great military failures have much to teach us about human stupidity and the limits of force in any arena

We also have many rich experiences that we do not analyze enough, that do not inspire us with ideas, whose lessons we ignore. Strategy requires a constant contact between the two realms. It is practical knowledge of the highest form. Events in life mean nothing if you do not reflect on them in a deep way, and ideas from books are pointless if they have no application to life as you live it.

We live in an era in which people are seldom directly hostile. The rules of engagement--social, political, military--have changed, and so must your notion of the enemy. An up-front enemy is rare now and is actually a blessing. People hardly ever attack you openly anymore, showing their intentions, their desire to destroy you; instead they are political and indirect. Although the world is more competitive than ever, outward aggression is discouraged, so people have learned to go underground, to attack unpredictably and craftily. Many use friendship as a way to mask aggressive desires: they come close to you to do more harm. (A friend knows best how to hurt you.) Or, without actually being friends, they offer assistance and alliance: they may seem supportive, but in the end they're advancing their own interests at your expense. Then there are those who master moral warfare, playing the victim, making you feel guilty for something unspecified you've done.

Historically, this local storage area has been managed by the storage driver, which we sometimes call the graph driver or graphdriver. Although the high-level concepts of stacking image layers and using copy-on-write technologies are constant, Docker on Linux supports several different storage drivers, each of which implements layering and copy-on-write in its own way. While these implementation differences do not affect the way we interact with Docker, they can have a significant impact on performance and stability

Selecting a storage driver is a per node decision. This means a single Docker host can only run a single storage driver — you cannot select the storage driver per-container.

If you change the storage driver on an already-running Docker host, existing images and containers will not be available after Docker is restarted. This is because each storage driver has its own subdirectory on the host where it stores image layers (usually below /var/lib/docker/<storage-driver>/...). Changing the storage driver obviously changes where Docker looks for images and containers. Reverting the storage driver to the previous configuration will make the older images and containers available again.

the Docker client • the Docker daemon (sometimes called “server” or “engine”) The daemon implements the Docker Engine API14. In a default Linux installation, the client talks to the daemon via a local IPC/Unix socket at /var/run/docker.sock. On Windows this happens via a named pipe at npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine. You can use the docker version command to test that the client and daemon (server) are running and talking to each other.

anomaly detection—for example, detecting unusual credit card transactions to prevent fraud, catching manufacturing defects, or automatically removing outliers from a dataset before feeding it to another learning algorithm. The system is shown mostly normal instances during training, so it learns to recognize them; then, when it sees a new instance, it can tell whether it looks like a normal one or whether it is likely an anomaly (see Figure 1-10). A very similar task is novelty detection: it aims to detect new instances that look different from all instances in the training set. This requires having a very “clean” training set, devoid of any instance that you would like the algorithm to detect. For example, if you have thousands of pictures of dogs, and 1% of these pictures represent Chihuahuas, then a novelty detection algorithm should not treat new pictures of Chihuahuas as novelties.

docker image build is the command that reads a Dockerfile and containerizes an application. The -t flag tags the image, and the -f flag lets you specify the name and location of the Dockerfile. With the -f flag, it is possible to use a Dockerfile with an arbitrary name and in an arbitrary location. The build context is where your application files exist, and this can be a directory on your local Docker host or a remote Git repo. • The FROM instruction in a Dockerfile specifies the base image for the new image you will build. It is usually the first instruction in a Dockerfile. • The RUN instruction in a Dockerfile allows you to run commands inside the image which create new layers. Each RUN instruction creates a single new layer. • The COPY instruction in a Dockerfile adds files into the image as a new layer. It is common to use the COPY instruction to copy your application code into an image. • The EXPOSE instruction in a Dockerfile documents the network port that the application uses. • The ENTRYPOINT instruction in a Dockerfile sets the default application to run when the image is started

Plus, the idea of sitting down at a desk and spending hundreds of hours writing a long document brought him to the edge of panic. He was a talker, not a writer. When he talked his ideas tumbled back and forth and he fed off the class and distilled his thoughts to the essence. But writing meant precision. And once on paper, the ideas could not be changed.

In early 1960 Boyd stopped dictating. Spradling carefully edited the document. But Boyd was not happy and spent weeks doing further editing, revisions, and more editing. Every sentence had to be right. Every maneuver had to be in the proper sequence. He agonized for hours over single words. He rewrote endlessly. After Spradling sent the document to the printer, Boyd still revised. Dozens of one-page corrections were sent to the printer. When Boyd finally, reluctantly, finished, he had a 150-page single-spaced manual that he called the “Aerial Attack Study” by “Capt. John Boyd.”

Boyd believed the “Aerial Attack Study” could be formulated another way, that there had to be a better method of articulating the contents, maybe even something beyond the maneuver-countermaneuver strategy, something that went even beyond the mathematical formulae to the core, the very essence, of combat flying.

Christie wanted a pamphlet, a briefing, a book, something codified that he could hold in his hand, something that could be presented to the Air Force. But Boyd was such a perfectionist that he would not write anything. What was the use of writing it if it was going to be changed five minutes later?

put two people to work doing nothing but E-M briefing charts. To say he was a perfectionist is an understatement of epic dimensions. Far into the night he pored over every detail on every slide. Each letter had to be exactly right. Every line in the cross-hatched performance chart had to be shaded correctly. Each slide had to be cropped precisely so. And if at 1:00 A.M. or 2:00 A.M. he found the slightest imperfection, something that no one else would have noticed, he called one of the technicians to come down and correct the slide.

Boyd was disgusted. He could tell that his dream for the pure fighter aircraft had vanished. Yes, he had cut some weight, and yes, he had killed the variable-sweep wing. But it had taken just about everything out of him to fight and fight and fight for so much that was so obvious. He knew that in its inexorable way the Air Force would add more gold-plating, more missions, to the F-15 until one day it would be barely recognizable. On October 24, 1968, he submitted papers saying he would retire the next year.

“The executives [listening to the pitches] thought they were evaluating the plans based on rational measures, such as: How original is this idea? How does it fit the current market? How well developed is this plan?” Pentland wrote. “While listening to the pitches, though, another part of their brain was registering other crucial information, such as: How much does this person believe in this idea? How confident are they when speaking? How determined are they to make this work? And the second set of information—information that the business executives didn’t even know they were assessing—is what influenced their choice of business plans to the greatest degree.”

One English artillery unit spoke of its “pet sniper” on the German side who would send his “good night kiss” every night promptly at nine-fifteen P.M., then shoot no more until the following morning. In another sector, an English machine-gunner would shoot out the rhythm of a popular song called “Policeman’s Holiday,” and his German counterpart would provide an answering refrain.

A research team led by UC Berkeley computer science professor Dawn Song tried this on gamers who were using neural interface to control a video game. As they played, the researchers inserted subliminal images into the game and probed the players’ unconscious brains for reaction to stimuli—like postal addresses, bank details, or human faces. Unbeknownst to the gamers, the researchers were able to steal information from their brains by measuring their unconscious brain responses that signaled recognition to stimuli, including a PIN code for one gamer’s credit card and their home address.

When I was in graduate school, I let my friend Bob Shore talk me into a multi-player game of War in the East. There were to be six of us involved, three per side. The only rule was that each side had to complete its movement in half an hour. I was given command of the central sector of the Russian line, whose initial dispositions had already been established by the overall Soviet commander. Although a good player, this commander was sometimes not as meticulous as I would have liked, especially when faced with a long front and several hundreds of units to deploy. Unfortunately, the commander of the German forces opposite my sector was both meticulous and observant. As the war opened with the German assault, I watched in horror as several panzer divisions overran elements of my front line and plunged deep into the rear, encircling a large portion of my forces while the German infantry pounded on them in the front. With the best positions for a secondary defensive line already in German hands and many of my reserve armored formations cut off, I faced my first movement phase. I also faced a very personal lesson in the meaning of the euphemistic gaming term "panic." As the clock ticked away I struggled to grasp the extent of disaster and to find ways to counter it. All hope of making careful and precise calculations of how many combat factors I would need to place in a given hex to prevent German overruns during the next turn proved vain. I scrambled in desperation to find some way of shoring up the front. I was only partially successful, but I was completely demoralized. In little over one hellish hour, I had had more first-hand experience of the frustration of having to deal with a failure by a higher command and the panic induced by a surprising and lightning-like penetration of defenses that had looked strong than I would ever care to repeat.

Here’s a story I like to tell in my presentations. You go to the mechanic, and he says you have to replace the carburetor. So you agree. There’s one problem: there is no carburetor in your car. Manufacturers haven’t made cars with carburetors for a few decades now! That’s how helpless we are! The other problem with mechanics is there’s no way to compare prices between different mechanics. When your car needs a new alternator and won’t run, you can’t exactly drive it around to the next nearest garage. If there’s no way to compare prices, it means the market is broken.

MANIPULATIVELY INSINCERE GUIDANCE happens when you don’t care enough about a person to challenge directly. People give praise and criticism that is manipulatively insincere when they are too focused on being liked or think they can gain some sort of political advantage by being fake—or when they are just too tired to care or argue any more. Guidance that is manipulatively insincere rarely reflects what the speaker actually thinks; rather, it’s an attempt to push the other person’s emotional buttons in return for some personal gain. “He’ll be happy if I tell him I liked his stupid presentation, and that will make my life easier than explaining why it sucked. In the long run, though, I really need to find someone to replace him.” Apple’s Chief Design Officer Jony Ive told a story about a time when he pulled his punches when criticizing his team’s work. When Steve Jobs asked Jony why he hadn’t been more clear about what was wrong, Jony replied, “Because I care about the team.” To which Steve replied, “No, Jony, you’re just really vain. You just want people to like you.” Recounting the story, Jony said, “I was terribly cross because I knew he was right.” That’s why Colin Powell said leadership is sometimes about being willing to piss people off.

So instead, I joined the Marines. That introduced me to an entirely new world, where I learned that there was a totally different way of living your life.

He addresses the rest of the room. “Unplanned work has another side effect. When you spend all your time firefighting, there’s little time or energy left for planning. When all you do is react, there’s not enough time to do the hard mental work of figuring out whether you can accept new work. So, more projects are crammed onto the plate, with fewer cycles available to each one, which means more bad multitasking, more escalations from poor code, which mean more shortcuts.

I tell them what Erik told me at mrp-8, about how wait times depend upon resource utilization. “The wait time is the ‘percentage of time busy’ divided by the ‘percentage of time idle.’ In other words, if a resource is fifty percent busy, then it’s fifty percent idle. The wait time is fifty percent divided by fifty percent, so one unit of time. Let’s call it one hour. So, on average, our task would wait in the queue for one hour before it gets worked. “On the other hand, if a resource is ninety percent busy, the wait time is ‘ninety percent divided by ten percent’, or nine hours. In other words, our task would wait in queue nine times longer than if the resource were fifty percent idle.”

Fear of failure may be a cultural thing. In some countries, failure is not acceptable and, as a result, there are fewer entrepreneurs per capita than in other countries. In Israel, for example, where failure is embraced, there is around one start-up per 1,400 people, while in Europe the number is one start-up per 20,000 people. Silicon Valley also has a low fear of failure, and as a result, more entrepreneurs per capita.

Entrepreneurs, by contrast, undertake each new effort with the same enthusiasm, with the “knowledge” and belief that this time it is going to work. No matter how many times they’ve tried, entrepreneurs always hold the conviction that this time it will work. That’s what fuels the journey of failures—the passion, the enthusiasm, and the false “knowledge” that this time is it. That belief is the nature of start-ups.

Entrepreneurs are troublemakers in most cases. They don’t take anything for granted. They’re not “good corporate employees.” As Kodak engineer Steve Sasson commented when he was put in charge of the project that resulted in the first digital camera, “It was just a project to keep me from getting into trouble doing something else.” Troublemakers usually don’t fit into the DNA of large corporations, and in many cases, they simply leave. Maybe because they are trying to do something else or maybe just because someone wants to get rid of them. I was fired from every place that I’ve worked. In the end, there was always the way that I wanted to do things (which obviously I thought was right) and there was the organization’s way of doing things. So, in some cases it would end up as, “This is how things are done,” and me saying it doesn’t make sense and that we should do it the other way around. Usually that was the beginning of the end. My longest tenure was at Comverse Technology—eleven years—and that ended with me being fired. A little while later, one of the executives at the company approached me. “We have no idea how we let one of our most creative minds go.” To which I replied, “You didn’t let me go. You fired me!”

I recall a dialogue with the CEO of a company telling me that he thinks his market will be disrupted and his current offering will be irrelevant five years down the road. “This is great,” I said. “You can start the change now.” I was surprised when he said, “I can’t. I can’t get my management to do something around it.” I offered to help. I was even ready to go and meet the management, but he said, “You’re crazy! You are going to tell them they will die if they don’t change. They will freak out. They are all very respected leaders and you will tell them they have no future without changing direction. No way can I allow that.” And then he asked if I had any other suggestions. “Yes,” I said. “Go to your chairman and resign.”

The argument back: “If we change either the value proposition or the target audience, then this is a new company or a pivot, which basically means we no longer believe in the problem we are trying to solve.” We ended up saying no—no to truckers, no to bike riders, no to pedestrians, no to public transportation, no to anything that wasn’t commuters. The one-million-dollar-a-year deal that we could have in 2009 was higher than the revenues of Waze in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and was about the same order of magnitude of revenues we made in 2012 and 2013. Over the years I have told this story to people, and I am always asked, “Why not both?” And the answer is very simple: focus. A start-up, in order to be successful, needs to do one and only one thing right, and to increase the likelihood of doing so, it needs to say no to everything else. Focus is not only about what we are doing; it is about what we are not doing! These are the hard decisions to say no to. The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.

Achieving simplicity will take iterations. You might have thought it would be a good idea to require registration before using the product. After all, you want to capture that user data for marketing and advertising purposes. But if you lose 50 percent of your users because they don’t know what they’re registering for, are not yet comfortable sharing their personal information (or any information), or simply because the process is long, you’ve not built a simple-to-use product.

How do you tell a good story? You’re trying to create emotional engagement and make them imagine they are part of it. Therefore, the story needs to be authentic. Making up a “use case”—a common part of business plans and marketing documents that describes in detail who a product’s users will be and exactly how they will use it—doesn’t fly. Telling someone else’s use case can still create the authenticity you need, but the most important thing is to make the listener (in this case, the investor) believe he or she is part of the story (that is, you want them to think: “It can happen to me”). They need to “feel” the story, even if it’s not exactly true.

It doesn’t matter where the story comes from. If the CEO can throw his or her “all” into the story, to make it authentic, to create true emotional engagement so that investors can imagine themselves in the story—maybe they’re frustrated, maybe they’re angry, maybe they want revenge—that makes all the difference. Remember what I said before: Investors are users as well. If you’re an investor and you don’t think you’re going to use the product an entrepreneur is pitching, you won’t invest.

That turns out to be one of the biggest challenges in start-up strategy in general. Imagine the following: As CEO, for the last six to nine months you were completely focused on fundraising. It took a huge amount of effort and attention, and you were 150 percent invested in it. Then it’s over. The next day you certainly want to—and should—celebrate, but the day after, you have to dive back into execution, building the product, crafting your go-to-market strategy, and firing and hiring. Over the years I have learned how very critical it is to maintain the execution plan of the start-up while at the same time the CEO is distracted by the fundraising process. Execution must remain on track, in particular, to feed the fundraising cycles. Investors may like your story, but they are still expecting to see progress. If you can show them progress within two, three, or four months, then they will be game to continue.

The metrics—This is basically an accurate and consistent measurement of each one of the gates over time. This is how you know where to focus your efforts to improve, and determine whether or not you are improving. •The learning—In order to understand why this is a barrier (you know it is because you just measured it), you need to speak to users who failed at this gate and ask them one very simple question: Why? There is no one else in the world who can tell you that. Active or retained users don’t have an issue with this particular gate and therefore they don’t know how to answer the question. You or your product lead don’t know either; after all, if you had known, it wouldn’t be a gate. So, all of a sudden, when you are in the iterations of PMF, the most important person in the world is the one who failed. Only that person can reveal to you the secret: the why. Because this learning is critical, I would say that everyone in the organization must understand the issues and, in particular, understand the users.

Fewer features mean better usability. Who should be speaking with users? And who should be watching new users? Start with the CEO and then add everyone in the start-up. You need to have that sense of listening to users as a key part of your company’s DNA—everyone needs to speak with and watch them.

Once an early majority is starting to use a product, initially they are very suspicious; for them, the shift to a new product has a toll to be paid, and the proof of value should be rather instantaneous. If you recommend to me a new travel site that says, “I can find you better deals,” I want to see the better deals compared to the other travel site I typically use. If the two are the same, it means there’s no value in the new product.

To reach PMF, use the funnel of the user as your key way of measuring, removing, or improving one barrier at a time. •While you want to believe your customers know how to navigate the system, most of your users are new. They are clueless and don’t read anything these days. •The only way to reexperience first-time use is to watch new users. •You can only learn by watching new users and asking those who failed at a barrier: “Why? What happened?” •Rule of thumb: Users convert on the third use. •You’ll be surprised, but daily use is more like seven times a month and those who keep on using your product forever make up just 30 percent retention after three months. •Prepare for dozens of iterations to remove the barriers and improve conversion and retention.

All startup advice is only useful in context, and I am a firm believer that the only good generic startup advice is that there is no good generic startup advice.

One of the things you see crystal clearly in VC is how much competition emerges whenever anything works. Every single time we say, “Oh, this startup is unique. There’s some unique product here and there’s not going to be competition,” invariably six months later there are 20 venturebacked competitors doing the exact same thing. And so at some point, if the early guys don’t get to the other 95% of the market, somebody else is going to go take it away. And whoever has 95% of the market, number one they’re going to get all the value

Someone now “owns” an area you used to run, but after 4-8 weeks you find you are still doing most of the work or weighing in on every decision, however small. You feel the need to jump in on every email thread or attend every meeting across the company.

attend to numerous pieces of data. We find that our brains are uncooperative when we try to absorb many details simultaneously. We may forget much of what we see or hear. When we try to remember sequential details, we can lose the first step before we can assimilate the second. Our preference for the gestalt (the big picture) over miscellaneous details may in part result from this difficulty with data processing. The “Don’t Do Today What You Can Put Off Till Tomorrow” Dynamic Many people live by this creed. Requesting several extensions on a federal income tax filing can put off this onerous task as long as possible. But we’re not talking about a conscious decision to procrastinate. We’re talking about the frustration many of us feel every time we try to get started on anything. What appears to be stalling or an apparent unwillingness to do something is often a sign of the superhuman effort required to begin concentrating on a new task. Refocusing is painful. It takes a lot of blood, sweat and tears. Although an ADDer may do well after he gets going, he has to work hard to shut out the rest of the world and turn off the other channels. It’s possible to become more efficient at self-starting but it takes time and self-discipline to learn this skill.

Lying may even be a prerequisite for succeeding as an entrepreneur—after all, you need to convince others that something is true in the absence of good, hard evidence. You need believers to take a leap of faith with you. As an entrepreneur, you need to live in a semi-delusional state just to survive the inevitable rollercoaster ride of running your startup. Small lies are essential. They create your reality distortion feld. They are a necessary part of being an entrepreneur. But if you start believing your own hype, you won’t survive.

The real metric of interest—the actionable one—is “percent of users who are active. ” This is a critical metric because it tells us about the level of engagement your users have with your product. When you change something about the product, this metric should change, and if you change it in a good way, it should go up. That means you can experiment, learn, and iterate with it.

Another interesting metric to look at is “number of users acquired over a specifc time period. ” Often, this will help you compare different marketing approaches—for example, a Facebook campaign in the frst week, a reddit campaign in the second, a Google AdWords campaign in the third, and a LinkedIn campaign in the fourth. Segmenting experiments by time in this way isn’t precise, but it’s relatively easy.* And it’s actionable: if Facebook works better than LinkedIn, you know where to spend your money.

A human won’t evolve an eagle’s eye, because the intermediate steps all result in bad eyesight.Machine-only optimization suffers from similar limitations as evolution. If you’re optimizing for local maxima, you might be missing a bigger, more important opportunity. It’s your job to be the intelligent designer to data’s evolution. Many of the startup founders with whom we’ve spoken have a fundamental mistrust of leaving their businesses to numbers alone. They want to trust their guts. They’re uneasy with their companies being optimized without a soul, and see the need to look at the bigger picture of the market, the problem they’re solving, and their fundamental business models.Ultimately, quantitative data is great for testing hypotheses, but it’s lousy for generating new ones unless combined with human introspection. Pattern | How to Think Like a Data Scientist Monica Rogati, a data scientist at LinkedIn, gave us the following 10 common pitfalls that entrepreneurs should avoid as they dig into the data their startups capture.1. Assuming the data is clean. Cleaning the data you capture is often most of the work, and the simple act of cleaning it up can often reveal important patterns.“Is an instrumentation bug causing 30% of your numbers to be null?” asks Monica.“Do you really have that many users in the 90210 zip code?” Check your data at the door to be sure it’s valid and useful.2. Not normalizing. Let’s say you’re making a list of popular wedding destinations. You could count the number of people ﬂying in for a wedding, but unless you consider the total number of air travellers coming to that city as well, you’ll just get a list of cities with busy airports.3. Excluding outliers. Those 21 people using your product more than a thousand times a day are either your biggest fans, or bots crawling your site for content. Whichever they are, ignoring them would be a mistake.4. Including outliers. While those 21 people using your product a thousand times a day are interesting from a qualitative perspective, because they can show you things you didn’t expect, they’re not good for building a general model.“You probably want to excludeChter 4: Data-Drien Vers Data-Informed 39

. However, most of the decisions that we make in discovery are reversible decisions. If we do the necessary work to test our decisions, we can quickly correct course when we find that we made the wrong decision. This gives us the luxury of moving quickly, rather than falling prey to analysis paralysis. The habits in this book will teach you how to make fast decisions and then quickly test to understand the consequences of those decisions. You’ll learn to adapt as you go rather than slow down to analyze.

During their customer interviews, Sonja’s team uncovered two primary factors that led to customer churn. First, not all tails.com customers understood the value of tailor-made dog food, and, second, some dogs simply didn’t like the food. Sonja’s team realized that they could prevent churn, and thus increase retention, if they fo cused on increasing the perceived value of tailor-made dog food and if they increased the number of dogs that liked the food. Their customer interviews helped them identify two product outcomes that were more actionable—they could measure their impact on both metrics right away, and they believed if they drove both, they would, in turn, drive their business outcome of increasing retention.11

When we manage by outcomes, we give our teams the autonomy, responsibility, and ownership to chart their own path. Instead of asking them to deliver a fixed roadmap full of features by a specific date in time, we are asking them to solve a customer problem or to address a business need. The key distinction with this strategy over traditional roadmaps is that we are giving the team the autonomy to find the best solution. If they are truly a continuous-discovery team, the product trio has a depth of customer and technology knowledge, giving them an advantage when it comes to making decisions about how to solve specific problems

For example, Sonja’s team may already know that customers want to use the transition calendar—perhaps they use it every day—but the recommended schedule isn’t as effective as they hoped it would be. In this case, it might make sense to have a team focused on optimizing the schedule. If the broader discovery questions have already been answered, then it’s perfectly fine to assign a traction metric to a team. The key is to use traction metrics only when you are optimizing a solution and not when the intent is to discover new solutions. In those instances, a product outcome is a better fit

This then sets the stage for the two-way negotiation. If the business needs the team to have a bigger impact on the outcome, the trio will need to adjust their strategy to be more ambitious, and the product leader will need to understand that more ambitious outcomes carry more risk. The team will need to make bigger bets to increase their chance of success, but these bigger bets typically come with a higher chance of failure. Similarly, the product leader and product trio can negotiate resources (e.g., adding engineers to the team) and/or remove competing tasks from the team’s backlog, giving them more time to focus on delivering their outcome

More recent research on goal setting involving more complex tasks, like the ones product trios face, found that challenging goals can decrease performance if the team doesn’t have strategies for how to achieve their goal. These studies found that encouraging teams to “do their best” was more effective than setting specific, challenging goals. Additionally, these studies found that setting an initial learning goal (e.g., discover the strategies that might work) was more effective than setting a performance goal. Only once appropriate strategies were identified did performance increase with a specific, challenging performance goal.18

product trios, when faced with a new outcome, should first start with a learning goal (e.g., discover the opportunities that will drive engagement) before being tasked with a performance goal (e.g., increase engagement by 10%). This approach can be particularly helpful because it’s common to have uncertainty around the best way to measure your outcome. We often need to do some discovery to learn how to best measure a product outcome. For example, when Sonja’s team started investigating retention as an outcome, they had no idea what they would uncover. Rather than spinning their wheels trying to define the perfect, specific, measurable retention metric, her team focused on learning what led to churn and used that knowledge to revise their metric over time.

Pursuing too many outcomes at once. Most of us are overly optimistic about what we can achieve in a short period of time. No matter how hard we work, our companies will always ask more of us. Put these two together, and we often see product trios pursuing multiple outcomes at once. What happens when we do this is that we spread ourselves too thin. We make incremental progress (at best) on some of our outcomes but rarely have a big impact on any of our outcomes. Most teams will have more of an impact by focusing on one outcome at a time. Ping-ponging from one outcome to another. Because many businesses have developed fire-fighting cultures—where every customer complaint is treated like a crisis—it’s common for product trios to ping-pong from one outcome to the next, quarter to quarter. However, you’ve already learned that it takes time to learn how to impact a new outcome. When we ping-pong from outcome to outcome, we never reap the benefits of this learning curve. Instead, set an outcome for your team, and fo cus on it for a few quarters. You’ll be amazed at how much impact you have in the second and third quarters after you’ve had some time to learn and explore.

The team could have increased the number of reviews on their platform, but if they all clustered around a small number of courses, or if they were all on courses that students didn’t view, they wouldn’t have an impact. A better outcome is “Increase the number of course views that include reviews.” To shift your outcome from less of an output to more of an outcome, question the impact it will have

It’s easy when working in a team to experience groupthink. Groupthink occurs when a group of individuals underperform due to the dynamics of the group. There are a number of reasons for this. When working in a group, it’s common for some members to put in more effort than others; some group members may hesitate or even refrain from speaking up, and groups tend to perform at the level of the leastcapable member.19 In order to leverage the knowledge and expertise in our trios, we need to actively work to counter groupthink.

Direct questions require that we recall facts without context. This process is prone to cognitive biases—common patterns in mental errors that result from the way our brains process information.23 We are bad at quantifying how often we do something. We often speculate about what we did, when, and why. We tend to favor generalities over specifics. We give answers that are influenced more by our sense of identity rather than our actual behavior. And we tend to come up with coherent reasons to explain our behavior that are often not grounded in reality. To be clear, this behavior is a function of how our brains work and not the result of interview participants trying to deceive us. In fact, many of these biases come into play because our interview subjects are trying to be helpful.

Gazzaniga named this tendency to rationalize our behavior even when we can’t possibly know the reason as the “left brain interpreter,” and later studies have shown that we all have an active “left brain interpreter.”25 We need to reconcile the present with the past, and when information is missing, our brains simply fill in details that make the story coherent.

many details as possible, to leave nothing out, and that, when they are done with their story, you’ll ask for missing details. Even so, you may still have to dig to uncover the full story. You can use common storytelling tactics to help you do so. A good story has a protagonist who encounters experiences on a timeline. Temporal prompts are one of the most effective ways to guide the participant through their own story. You can ask, “Start at the beginning. What happened first?” You can use the experience map you created in Chapter 4 to help guide your participant. Prompt for the beginning of the story. If your participant isn’t sure where to start, you can further prompt, “Where were you? Set the scene for me.” As the participant tells their story, you can encourage them to keep going by asking them, “What happened next?” Sometimes they might skip a fe w steps, and you may need to ask, “What happened before that?” Thinking about their story as having a beginning, a middle, and an end can help you guide the participant.

We should compare and contrast the impact of addressing one opportunity against the impact of addressing another opportunity.

Lottie Bullens and colleagues, social psychologists at the University of Amsterdam, found in a series of studies that, when people viewed a decision as reversible, they continued to critically evaluate their decision after making it. In fact, they were more likely to see the negative attributes of their choice and the positive attributes of the alternatives after making the decision if they viewed it as a reversible decision. If they framed it as an irreversible decision, the opposite happened. People noticed only the positive attributes of their own choice and the negative attributes of the alternatives.34 If we want to stay open to being wrong and avoid confirmation bias, it’s critical that we think of our prioritization decisions as reversible decisions

Not only that, but you also tried 100 times harder than the average person does to keep organized. This proves your effort is high, even if it feels bad to think about it. The same goes for whatever the popular new notes app is. I tried them all. The only thing I found I could keep using was a single folder on my computer with text files. Simple plain text. No crazy checklist features. No calendar integrations. No API to connect to. I can’t even post images in my notes because it’s just text files. What worked the best for me was immediate, quick access. I can open my text editor in under a second. Could I do the same with some bloated app with 1000 different features?

He does not blame himself or feel shame. He just tries something new. He has a good mindset.

We're mammals and parental care of the young is essential for the continuance of the hereditary lines. The parent smiles at the child, the child smiles back, and a bond is forged or strengthened. As soon as the infant can see, it recognizes faces, and we now know that this skill is hardwired in our brains. Those infants who a million years ago were unable to recognize a face smiled back less, were less likely to win the hearts of their parents and less likely to prosper. These days, nearly every infant is quick to identify a human face and to respond with a goony grin.

The connectome that lights up when you’re engaged in a task is called the task-positive network, or TPN. Aptly named, the TPN gets you down to work. You’re deliberately doing something and you are intent on it, unaware of much beyond the bounds of what you’re doing. In this state, you don’t consciously know whether you’re happy or not, which is just as good as being happy, if not better, because you’re not wasting any energy in selfassessment. You may become frustrated with what you’re doing and have moments of anger or dismay, but if you stay in the task, in the TPN, those moments will pass, and the TPN, buoyant connectome that it is, will carry you along

default mode network (DMN). The DMN allows for expansive, imaginative, and creative thinking. The back half of the DMN—called the posterior cingulate—facilitates your autobiographic memory, your personal history. This allows you to think back, draw upon, and pick apart the past. The front part, the medial prefrontal cortex, is the opposite. It enables you to look forward and to think about, imagine, and plan for the future.

Another extremely common problem when caught in the DMN is what we call “pirouette syndrome,” a circling back to make sure you’ve done something you’ve already done. Some people pirouette to be sure they’ve locked the front door, or didn’t leave eggs boiling on the stove; others circle back to fnd something they are sure they’ve forgotten: sunglasses, a wallet. When you aren’t paying attention in your TPN, it takes a lot of energy to check and double-check to make sure you didn’t pull a royal screw-up. Chances are you did lock the door, took the eggs of the stove, and had your sunglasses on top of your head, but because you weren’t focused in the moment

caveat: Even though we’ve touted the TPN as your ally and friend, it’s important to note that it’s not blameless and it, too, can go to the extreme. Indeed, we often refer to people who are the opposite of ADHD as having “attention surplus disorder.” These are the bureaucrats, the automatons, the emotionless, by-the-book, detail-oriented types who are never late and always obey rules but never have new ideas and never laugh. They are habitually stuck in the TPN. Think about Uncle Ron and his analytical focus on his plants, losing sight of any empathy for the beloved wife he left at the store. When you’re stuck in the TPN, it’s easy to think about people in mechanical rather than relational ways. Whoever came up with the expression “one track mind” was inadvertently describing the TPN

The Columbia University professor and psychiatrist Kelli Harding gathered much of the research into the power of love and connection in her 2019 book, The Rabbit Efect. The title derives from a study on rabbits who were fed a high-fat diet to show the efect of high cholesterol on the health of the heart. Not surprisingly, the rabbits showed large deposits of fat in their coronary arteries on autopsy. They had not been healthy. Except for one anomalous group of rabbits that showed 60 percent fewer fatty deposits than all the others. Same diet, same strain of rabbits, same lab, same age, but this one group had markedly lower deposits of fat in their hearts. It was a complete mystery to the investigators. Being good scientists, they looked further for an explanation. The salient variable that ended up explaining the diference had nothing to do with diet, exercise, genetics, or any of the other standard reasons a scientist might expect. The explanation lay in the kindness shown to those rabbits by the lab technician who managed their group. She handled the rabbits in her care afectionately, talking to them and petting them while she fed them and cleaned their cages. She doted on them as a loving owner dotes on favorite pets. She was no mere lab tech, she was a purveyor of love. Love made the diference.

M ost people who have ADHD or VAST are naturally creative and original. They think along unusual lines and feel a persistent drive to build, develop, or create something, anything, from a business to a boat to a book to a balustrade. It’s like an omnipresent itch to make something. If that itch goes unscratched, we tend to feel listless or depressed, unmotivated and at sea. If we pour our energies into something that is beneath our creative abilities, we tend to lose interest.Remember, boredom = kryptonite. If we fnd ourselves in a job that doesn’t draw on that creative strength but instead demands a skill set we just don’t have, we will falter— and we’ll feel the crush of that defeat harder than others do. But once we fnd an outlet for our creativity that is a Goldilocks kind of just right, once we fnd a project to sink our teeth into, then presto! we light up like a Christmas tree

Of course, it’s true that most people who have ADHD or VAST are really bad at quite a few things (in which their noses get rubbed all the time), but usually they are, or could be, truly exceptional at one or two other activities. Toward that end, we take a strength-based approach to treating people in our practices. As we like to say, we do not treat disabilities, we help people unwrap their gifts.

major reason kids with attention issues do poorly in school is that they feel bored, which in turn leads the teacher to believe they don’t care about schoolwork. If the teacher can work your child’s interests into the curriculum (or just allow your child to pursue them during downtime), your child is likely to show a whole new level of interest in school. This creates a positive feedback loop—your child’s interest and attention in class may lead the teacher to more often give her or him the beneft of the doubt instead

Another, less polite way of saying it: People with attention issues tend to have acute bullshit detectors. We hate hypocrisy maybe more than any other human failing, and we can spot it a mile away.

Sleep apnea is in what’s called the “diferential diagnosis” of ADHD, the list of conditions that can mimic ADHD. Also on that list are hyper- and hypothyroidism; depression; cafeinism (drinking too much cofee or other cafeinated beverages); bipolar disorder; anxiety disorders; pheochromocytoma (tumor of the adrenal gland that causes it to secrete large amounts of adrenaline); substance use disorders; post-traumatic stress disorder; and the carrying of too many secrets and too much shame (not a formal diagnosis, but we see it a lot). All of these conditions can not only mimic ADHD but also accompany it.

Most people understand that asking for help is not a sign of weakness, at least in most contexts. If you’re a new parent, for instance, there’s usually no shame in asking for advice or help from your parents or friends, or from your new baby’s pediatrician. There is certainly still stigma around seeking help for postpartum depression, but even that is dissipating as more and more women raise their hands to say they’ve experienced it and more and more doctors screen for signs of it. So it should be for asking for help for ADHD or VAST. As we say all the time to our patients: Don’t just tough it out. Work smart, not just hard. The social limitations of ADHD/VAST can be painful and disabling, so it is important to take this step seriously

word problems in math, then you need a specialist who can go beyond ABA training skills, who can do more than tell the child what actions to ape, what words to recite, what motions to go through. You need a coach who can help your child think and feel through all the various steps that combine to create the amazingly complex interaction called “getting along.” This comes naturally to some children, just as skating backward does to some. But to others it is utterly foreign, just as some children fall on their butts when they try to skate backward. However, there is a knack to both that can be broken down into learnable steps. You do not have to be born with the knack. You can learn it inductively, rather than memorize it or have it conditioned into you. This is the great discovery that separates social learning from behaviorist training

Failing to master the adaptive pursuit of dopamine leads to addictions of all kinds, but mastering it leads to success and joy.

Finally, the world is catching on that our issue isn’t laziness or disrespect or self-indulgence. No, our neural functioning is slightly but meaningfully diferent from that of the “neurotypicals” in the population. There is a sometimes glitchy connection between our task-positive network and the default mode network in our brains. And our cerebellum—another area of the brain—is often a little of balance and in need of strengthening. In other words, the science is proving that we aren’t just trying to be difcult; we’re really having a difcult time inside. We also know that connection to others, identifying our strengths and focusing on them instead of our weaknesses, setting up systems of structure in our environments, getting exercise, and taking medication all really help with these glitches and imbalances.

There is abundant time for posthuman evolution, here on Earth or far beyond, organic or inorganic, to give rise to far more diversity and even greater qualitative changes than those that have led from single-celled organisms to humans. Indeed, this conclusion is strengthened when we realize that future evolution will proceed not on the million-year time scale characteristic of Darwinian selection but at the much accelerated rate allowed by genetic modification and the advance of machine intelligence (and forced by the drastic environmental pressures that would confront any humans who were to construct habitats beyond the Earth).

He and Ren would grab lunch from one of the food trucks and sit on the campus lawn, where Musk would read academic papers on batteries. California had just passed a requirement mandating that 10 percent of vehicles by 2003 had to be electric. “I want to go make that happen,” Musk said.

In a 2011 Harvard Business Review article, Peter Fuda and Richard Badham use a series of metaphors to explore how leaders spark and sustain change. One of the metaphors is the snowball. The snowball starts rolling when a leader is willing to be vulnerable with his or her subordinates. Their research shows that this act of vulnerability is predictably perceived as courageous by team members and inspires others to follow suit.

People who are masters in their field (e.g., art, music, sports, public speaking) have a different way of seeing the world. Greene believes the word genius should be demystified because we have “access to information and knowledge that past masters could only dream about.

I was faced with the presenter’s problem: You can have incredible knowledge about your subject. You can make your most important points clearly, even with passion, and you can be very well organized. You can do all those things as well as they can be done—and still not be convincing. That’s because a great pitch is not about procedure. It’s about getting and keeping attention. And that means you have to own the room with frame control, drive emotions with intrigue pings, and get to a hookpoint fairly quickly. (Details on those last two in a second.)

First, the history. Recent breakthroughs in neuroscience show that our brain developed in three separate stages. First came the old brain, or “crocodile brain”—we’ll call it the “croc brain” for short. It’s responsible for the initial filtering of all incoming messages, it generates most survival fight-or-flight responses, and it produces strong, basic emotions, too. But when it comes to decision making, the croc brain’s reasoning power is . . . well, primitive. It simply doesn’t have a lot of capacity, and most of what it does have is devoted primarily to the things it takes to keep us alive. When I am referring to the croc brain, I am referring to this level. The midbrain, which came next, determines the meaning of things and social situations. And finally, the neocortex evolved with a problem-solving ability and is able to think about complex issues and produce answers using reason

You may be where I was about 10 years ago. Back then, I subscribed to “the brain is like a computer” metaphor. With a computer, if I send you an Excel spreadsheet file, you open it and read it in Excel. This is how I thought the brain worked. If I created a message in my smart neocortex and “sent” it over to you (by telling you about it), I figured that you’d be opening that message in your neocortex. But no pitch or message is going to get to the logic center of the other person’s brain without passing through the survival filters of the crocodile brain system first. And because of the way we evolved, those filters make pitching anything extremely difficult. So instead of communicating with people, my best ideas were bouncing off their croc brains and crashing back into my face in the form of objections, disruptive behaviors, and lack of interest.

Because while you are talking about “profit potential,” “project synergy,” “return on investment,” and “why we should move forward now”—concepts your upper brain is comfortable with—the brain of the person on the other side of the desk isn’t reacting to any of those highly evolved, relatively complicated ideas. It is reacting exactly as it should. It is trying to determine whether the information coming in is a threat to the person’s immediate survival and, if it isn’t, whether it can be ignored without consequence

This filtering system of the crocodile brain has a very short-sighted view of the world. Anything that is not a crisis it tries to mark as “spam.” If you got a chance to look at the croc brain’s filtering instructions, it would look something like this: 1. If it’s not dangerous, ignore it. 2. If it’s not new and exciting, ignore it. 3. If it is new, summarize it as quickly as possible—and forget about the details. And finally there is this specific instruction: 4. Do not send anything up to the neocortex for problem solving unless you have a situation that is really unexpected and out of the ordinary

Sure, after initial filtering, parts of your message move quickly through the midbrain and on to the neocortex—business meetings would be very odd otherwise—but the damage to your message and your pitch has already been done. First, given the limited focus and capacity of the croc brain, up to 90 percent of your message is discarded before it’s passed on up to the midbrain and then on to the neocortex. The crocodile brain just doesn’t process details well, and it only passes along big, obvious chunks of concrete data. Second, unless your message is presented in such a way that the crocodile brain views it to be new and exciting—it is going to be ignored. Third, if your pitch is complicated—if it contains abstract language and lacks visual cues—then it is perceived as a threat. Not a threat in the sense that the person listening to your pitch fears he is going to be attacked, but a threat because without cues and context, the croc brain concludes that your pitch has the potential to absorb massive amounts of brain power to comprehend. And that is a major threat because there just isn’t enough brain power to handle survival needs, the problems of day-to-day life, and existing work problems plus whatever unclear thing you are asking it to do. Presented with this kind of situation, a circuit breaker in your brain is tripped. The result? A neurotoxin gets attached to the potentially threatening message (your pitch). This is like a FedEx tracking number, which, in turn, routes your message to the amygdala for processing—and destruction. Now, if there is one place in the brain you do not want your pitch to end up, it is the amygdala. This is the fear circuitry of the brain. The amygdala turns messages into physical sensations like a faster heart rate, sweating, increased breathing, and increased anxiety. And it produces a feeling that makes the person want to escape from the presentation

Belzberg remained standing and almost immediately cut Tom off, “Look, I only want to know two things from you. What are monthly expenses, and how much are you paying yourself?” Not what Tom wanted to hear. He had a different pitch planned, and now he was looking foolish, searching his bag to find expense charts. Where were the confidence and nerves of hardened titanium? He dropped his papers and stuttered a bit. He was lost. Belzberg had said only 20 words. As you will see, it’s possible for a 20-word disruption to control the fate of any deal. Why is that? An analogy, like the one below, might help explain all this. Imagine for a moment that there is some kind of powerful energy field that surrounds all of us, silently transmitting from the depths of our subconscious. This invisible defense shield is genetically designed to protect our conscious minds from sudden intrusion by ideas and perspectives that are not our own. When that energy field is overwhelmed, however, it collapses. Our mental defenses fail, and we become subject to another person’s ideas, desires, and commands. That person can impose his will. No one really knows whether there are human energy fields or not, but perhaps this is the best way to think about the mental structures that shape the way we see the world, which I call frames. And in a moment, you will begin to understand what happened when Tom’s frame came into contact with—and collapsed under—Bill Belzberg’s power frame. Imagine looking at the world through a window frame that you hold in your hands. As you move the frame around, the sounds and images you encounter are interpreted by your brain in ways that are consistent with your intelligence, values, and ethics. This is your point of view. Another person can look at the same thing through his own frame, and what he hears and sees may differ—by a little or a lot. The common label given to this is perspective. I might perceive and interpret things differently than you do—which is a good thing. Another perspective is often what we need as we nurture our ideas and values. Yet, as we interpret the world through our frames, something else happens. Our brains process what our senses tell us and quickly react with a series of questions: Is it dangerous? Should I eat it or mate with it? This is the croc brain at work, doing what it does best—detecting frames, protecting us from threats, and using dominance and aggression to deflect attacking ideas and information. There are millions of people in the business world, and each brings a frame to his or her social encounters. Whenever two or more people come together to communicate in a business setting, their frames square off and then come into contact, but not in a cooperative or friendly manner. Frames are extremely competitive—remember, they are rooted

By preaching the law of large numbers, the purveyors of sales techniques are asking you to work longer and harder, with no real competitive advantage. They are forcing you to compensate for your weak position with a Herculean effort to win new business, claiming that it’s just a numbers game.

I think of these things before I take a meeting: What are the basic primal attitudes and emotions that will be at play? Then I make simple decisions about the kind of frame I want to go in with. For many years, I used just four frames that would cover every business situation. For example, if I know the person I’m meeting is a hard-charging, type A personality, I will go in with a power-busting frame. If that person is an analytical, dollars-and-cents type, I will choose an intrigue frame. If I’m outnumbered and outgunned and the deck is stacked against me, time frames and prize frames are essential. I am also ready and willing to switch to a different frame as the social interaction develops or changes. Going into most business situations, there are three major types of opposing frames that you will encounter: 1. Power frame 2. Time frame 3. Analyst frame

I talked about the types of assets we wanted to buy and what we would pay. During a moment of pause, I looked over at Steve. He had taken our pitch book, flipped it over, and was absent-mindedly tracing his hand on the back of it with a pen. How significant is this lack of attention? Well, it’s pretty bad. However, if you view the world through the lens of traditional sales techniques, you would think there’s something wrong with my information or my deal. But instead, if you view the world through frames and social dynamics, then you would understand that the deal was fine. This is just the power frame coming at you, and in the collision of frames, you’ve just lost. I first thought, Ouch, how could this be happening? I had burned a lot of time and money getting to this meeting, and I could see our opportunity slipping away. The guy was tracing his hand on my executive summary. I felt two inches tall. My crocodile brain became overwhelmed with basic, primal emotions. I was frame-controlled. My simple, emotional, reactive croc brain told me to run, and I considered it. When you abide by the rituals of power instead of establishing your own, you reinforce the opposing power frame. I soon recovered my poise, and here is what followed: “Steve, gimme that,” I said, pulling the pitch book away from him. That’s a power frame disrupter. Dramatic pause . . . I looked at Steve’s drawing intently. “Hold on, wait a sec. Now I see what’s going on. This drawing is pretty damn good. Forget the big deal for a minute. How about you sell this to me. Name a price.” This is an extreme example of high-stakes power frames. But you can do this in everyday meetings in a far less dramatic way to change and refocus the frame to a totally different subject. If a guy is going to dominate you, let him dominate you on the price of something like a hand drawing in this case, something that doesn’t matter. If you find yourself in a similar situation (the day will come when this happens to you, too), then pick something abstract and start an intense price negotiation over it—and it doesn’t matter if you win or lose. The power of the person’s frame is rendered trivial, and the focus is back to you and what you want to do with the meeting. Steve didn’t expect this, and the concussion from the force of my frame-busting move completely changed the dynamic of that moment and the remainder of the meeting. I got another chance to get the focus back on the real subject—the $60 million I was there to spend. And now I had Steve’s complete attention.

Encountering the Power Frame Several years ago, I had a meeting at a large money center bank whose name you would recognize in an instant. This was supposed to be a onehour meeting, and it was made clear by the guy we were meeting that he would give us precisely one hour. This is classic power framing with hard time pressure thrown in. The cost of getting our team to Washington for this pitch was more than $20,000. But the meeting could be worth millions if we pitched it right. After my team and I were escorted through security, we rode the elevator to the nineteenth floor, where more than $1 trillion worth of business was traded each year. We felt like we were about to take a place among the nation’s most powerful and elite financial traders. Thirty-five traders moved billions of dollars a month here, and we were one hour away from being part of the game. I had contacted all my investors, and together we had pooled about $60 million in investment money that I was bringing to the table. My contact, a trader named Steve, was meeting us, and I would be pitching him and two analysts. After a long wait, an impeccably dressed young woman led us to the largest conference room I’ve ever seen, about half the size of a basketball court. Steve and his entourage came in and exchanged the standard pleasantries. Steve was one of the bigger volume traders on the floor. He showed up several minutes late and then spent 15 minutes talking about himself. A precious 22 minutes had been burned. Finally, I was able to hand out our materials and begin the pitch. During the economic boom of the time, Steve had become accustomed to doing $100 million deals that would close in a single day; by contrast, we had a $60 million deal that would take at least 30 days to close. So he didn’t seem terribly interested. I talked about the types of assets we wanted to buy and what we would pay. During a moment of pause, I looked over at Steve. He had taken our pitch book, flipped it over, and was absent-mindedly tracing his hand on the back of it with a pen. How significant is this lack of attention? Well, it’s pretty bad.

I looked at Steve’s drawing intently. “Hold on, wait a sec. Now I see what’s going on. This drawing is pretty damn good. Forget the big deal for a minute. How about you sell this to me. Name a price.” This is an extreme example of high-stakes power frames. But you can do this in everyday meetings in a far less dramatic way to change and refocus the frame to a totally different subject. If a guy is going to dominate you, let him dominate you on the price of something like a hand drawing in this case, something that doesn’t matter. If you find yourself in a similar situation (the day will come when this happens to you, too), then pick something abstract and start an intense price negotiation over it—and it doesn’t matter if you win or lose. The power of the person’s frame is rendered trivial, and the focus is back to you and what you want to do with the meeting. Steve didn’t expect this, and the concussion from the force of my frame-busting move completely changed the dynamic of that moment and the remainder of the meeting. I got another chance to get the focus back on the real subject—the $60 million I was there to spend. And now I had Steve’s complete attention. To instigate a power frame collision, use a mildly shocking but not unfriendly act to cause it. Use defiance and light humor. This captures attention and elevates your status by creating something called “local star power.” (You will read about creating status and local star power in Chapter 3.) Taking the Frame Here are some subtler examples of taking the power frame away. As soon as you come in contact with your target, look for the first opportunity to 1. Perpetrate a small denial, or 2.

Another common situation occurs when the key decision maker does not attend the meeting as was agreed to. This situation requires a special kind of response that not only will reaffirm your control of the frame but also will establish you as someone unlike anyone else they have dealt with. Let’s say that you’ve done everything right so far. You’ve come into the business interaction and quickly asserted strong frames and, hopefully, frame control with the people you’ve just met. You’re ready to start your pitch and are waiting for “Mr. Big” to come in, when his assistant steps in to announce, “I am so sorry. Mr. Big just called. He can’t make the meeting for another hour. He says to start without him.” She turns to leave. This is a defining moment for you. You have just lost the frame, and there is nothing you can do about it. However, this does not mean that you do not have choices. Your options are 1. Go ahead with your presentation, even though you know you’ve lost the frame, hope for the best, and hope that maybe Mr. Big will join the group toward the end of the meeting. I would not recommend this. 2. Stop everything. Reframe using power, time, or prize frames (which are covered in this chapter) or perhaps all three. Immediately take the power back. You’ve traveled to this meeting, prepared for it, and have an established goal. Are you willing to throw that away? No one can tell your story as well as you can. If you trust your presentation to subordinates and expect them to pass it on to the decision maker with the same force and qualities of persuasion that you have, then you are not being honest with yourself. Again, no one can tell your story as well as you can. Mr. Big must hear it. He must hear it from you. This is what I usually say in this situation: “So you guys are asking me to delay the start? Okay. I can give you 15 minutes to get organized. But if we can’t start by then, then let’s just call it a day.” Usually someone will volunteer to track down Mr. Big, and that person will try as hard as he or she can to find him and request that he join the meeting. Or someone will say, “Let’s go ahead with the presentation, and we’ll make sure that Mr. Big is briefed.” You can’t let your frame get absorbed by this. Your response? “No, we’re not going to follow your agenda. This meeting is going to start when I say start, and it will end when I say stop. You’re going to make sure that all the right people come to the meeting on time. Then we’re only going to cover the items on my agenda, and you’re going pay attention to every minute of my presentation.” You only think this way, of course. What you actually say is, “I can wait 15 minutes, but then I have to leave.” That’s enough to get the message through. The first time you think this way and say these words, you’ll be uncomfortable—no, make that terrified—and you’ll wonder if you are doing the right thing. Your heart will race, and you’ll fear the consequences of your boldness, afraid of having offended your audience. You’ll second-guess yourself and think you’ve just made an awful mistake. And then something awesome will happen. The people in the room will scramble, doing their best to prevent you from being offended, doing their best to keep you from leaving. They are worried about you. When you own the frame, others react to you

Startups struggle to see their work-in-progress inventory. When factories have excess WIP, it literally piles up on the factory 2oor. Because most startup work is intangible, it’s not nearly as visible. For example, all the work that goes into designing the minimum viable product is—until the moment that product is shipped—just WIP inventory. Incomplete designs, not-yet-validated assumptions, and most business plans are WIP. Almost every Lean Startup technique we’ve discussed so far works its magic in two ways: by converting push methods to pull and reducing batch size. Both have the net effect of reducing WIP

we wound up building a training program that was so good, new hires were productive on their 5rst day of employment. Within just a few weeks, those employees were contributing at a high level. It required a huge e3ort to standardize our work processes and prepare a curriculum of the concepts that new employees should learn. Every new engineer would be assigned a mentor, who would help the new employee work through a curriculum of systems, concepts, and techniques he or she would need to become productive at IMVU. The performance of the mentor and mentee were linked, so the mentors took this education seriously. What is interesting, looking back at this example, is that we never stopped work and decided that we needed to build a great training program. Instead, the training program evolved organically out of a methodical approach to evolving our own process. This process of orientation was subject to constant experimentation and revision so that it grew more effective—and less burdensome—over time. I call this building an adaptive organization, one that automatically adjusts its process and performance to current conditions

This is one of the most important discoveries of the lean manufacturing movement: you cannot trade quality for time. If you are causing (or missing) quality problems now, the resulting defects will slow you down later. Defects cause a lot of rework, low morale, and customer complaints, all of which slow progress and eat away at valuable resources

The Five Whys approach acts as a natural speed regulator. The more problems you have, the more you invest in solutions to those problems. As the investments in infrastructure or process pay o3, the severity and number of crises are reduced and the team speeds up again. With startups in particular, there is a danger that teams will work too fast, trading quality for time in a way that causes sloppy mistakes. Five Whys prevents that, allowing teams to 5nd their optimal pace. The Five Whys ties the rate of progress to learning, not just execution. Startup teams should go through the Five Whys whenever they encounter any kind of failure, including technical faults, failures to achieve business results, or unexpected changes in customer behavior.

Instead of asking why repeatedly in an attempt to understand what went wrong, frustrated teammates start pointing 5ngers at each other, trying to decide who is at fault. Instead of using the Five Whys to 5nd and 5x problems, managers and employees can fall into the trap of using the Five Blames as a means for venting their frustrations and calling out colleagues for systemic failures. Although it’s human nature to assume that when we see a mistake, it’s due to defects in someone else’s department, knowledge, or character, the goal of the Five Whys is to help us see the objective truth that chronic problems are caused by bad process, not bad people, and remedy them accordingly

Because of the training process we had developed at IMVU through the Five Whys, we routinely asked new engineers to make a change to the production environment on their 5rst day. For engineers trained in traditional development methods, this was often frightening. They would ask, “What will happen to me if I accidentally disrupt or stop the production process?” In their previous jobs, that was a mistake that could get them 5red. At IMVU we told new hires, “If our production process is so fragile that you can break it on your very 5rst day of work, shame on us for making it so easy to do so.” If they did manage to break it, we immediately would have them lead the e3ort to 5x the problem as well as the e3ort to prevent the next person from repeating their mistake.

I think it’s a best practice. When I came into Stripe, I had a similar document. I wrote a document back when I was at Google called, “Working with Claire.” And when I first got to Stripe, I adapted it slightly, but it was pretty relevant. I shared it with everyone who was working with me closely, but I made it an open document. It spread quite quickly through the organization. It made sense, because I was new, I was in a leadership role, people wanted to understand me. And then people started asking, “Well, why don’t we have more of these?” It’s been a little bit of a viral, organic adoption, and now a lot of people at Stripe have written their own guides to themselves. I’ve even had folks who are not managers but are on my team write me these guides to them. And it’s been super insightful. So I’m a huge fan. I think that founders should write a guide to working with them. It would be one of the pieces I’m describing, to clarify the founder’s role: “What do I want to be involved in? When do I want to hear from you? What are my preferred communication modes? What makes me impatient? Don’t surprise me with X.” That’s super powerful. Because the problem is, people learn it in the moment, and by then it’s too late.

In order to survive whatever difficulties we encountered at that time, we unwittingly mastered a limited repertoire of strategies, self-images, and behaviors that allowed us to cope with and survive in our early environment. Each of us therefore has become an “expert” at a particular form of coping which, if used excessively, also becomes the core of the dysfunctional area of our personality.

Unlike what our ego may believe, it is not our role to repair or transform ourselves. Indeed, one of the major obstacles to transformation is the idea that we can “fix” ourselves. This notion, of course, raises some interesting questions. What in us do we believe needs fixing, and what part of us is claiming the authority to be able to fix another part? What parts are the judge, the jury, and the defendant in the dock? What are the tools of punishment or rehabilitation, and what parts of us will wield them on what other parts?

Resumes, online bios, and even third-party recommendations can’t tell you what makes a person tick and what contributions he or she will make, or fail to make, in the unpredictable growth of the startup, nor can they tell you a person’s commitment level or whether he or she has what it takes to persevere through the scariest parts of the entrepreneurial roller-coaster ride. Such teams have much to gain by holding off their equity split until they have learned a lot more about each other, although they may pay a price for this benefit by sacrificing some of their ability to attract key cofounders (as did the Smartix team when it waited to split and thus lost the potential cofounder who had deep knowledge of and contacts in their industry).
